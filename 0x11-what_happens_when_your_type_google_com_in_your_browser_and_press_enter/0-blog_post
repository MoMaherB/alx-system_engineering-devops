What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com in Your Browser and Press Enter?
When you type a URL like https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a complex series of events unfold. Let's break down the journey of your request through various components of the web stack.

1. The DNS Request:

When you enter the URL, your browser first needs to translate the human-readable domain name ("www.google.com") into an IP address, which is a numerical address that computers use to communicate. This is where the Domain Name System (DNS) comes into play.

Your browser sends a DNS request to a local DNS server, which acts like a phonebook for the internet. The local DNS server then searches its cache for the corresponding IP address. If it doesn't find it, it starts a chain of requests to other DNS servers until it eventually finds the correct IP address associated with "www.google.com."

2. TCP/IP Connection:

Once your browser has the IP address, it establishes a connection with the server using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) over the Internet Protocol (IP). This is like setting up a phone line between your computer and Google's server. TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, while IP handles the actual routing of packets across the internet.

3. Firewall:

Before reaching Google's server, your request might encounter a firewall. This acts as a security guard, filtering incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules. It prevents unauthorized access to your computer and protects your data.

4. HTTPS/SSL:

Google uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) to encrypt the communication between your browser and its server. This is crucial for protecting your personal information like passwords and search queries from being intercepted. The encryption process relies on Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), which creates a secure connection by exchanging digital certificates and using encryption algorithms.

5. Load Balancer:

Google's servers are likely spread across multiple data centers worldwide. To handle the massive number of requests it receives, Google uses a load balancer to distribute traffic evenly among these servers. This ensures that no single server gets overloaded and helps maintain optimal performance.

6. Web Server:

Once your request reaches the appropriate server, the web server processes it. It receives the HTTP request, checks your request details (like the URL and HTTP headers), and retrieves the corresponding web page from the application server.

7. Application Server:

The web server communicates with the application server to dynamically generate the HTML content of the Google homepage. This involves retrieving data from the database, processing it according to your search query, and generating the final HTML code.

8. Database:

The application server interacts with a database to retrieve the necessary information. This could be the results for your search query, your Google account data, or any other relevant information needed to build the web page.

9. Rendering:

Finally, the generated HTML code is sent back to your browser through the established TCP/IP connection. Your browser then renders the HTML code, interprets CSS styles, and loads images and other resources to display the fully functional Google homepage on your screen.
