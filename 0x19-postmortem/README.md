Incident 503 Error / Web Application Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: The outage occurred on August 15, 2024, lasting from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM UTC (2 hours).
Impact: The web application, used primarily by biomedical companies to manage device and hospital information, experienced a complete outage. Users were unable to access any services, resulting in a 100% impact on the user base. Executives and clients were unable to access or update critical data during this period, leading to significant operational disruptions.
Root Cause: The outage was caused by a misconfigured Nginx load balancer, which failed to distribute traffic across the application servers, leading to overwhelming traffic on a single server and eventual server crash.

Timeline
1:55 PM UTC: Monitoring system detected a sharp increase in response times and CPU usage on the main application server.
2:00 PM UTC: Users began reporting 503 Service Unavailable errors when attempting to access the application.
2:05 PM UTC: Initial investigation focused on checking the health of the application servers and database servers.
2:15 PM UTC: The assumption was made that the issue might be related to a recent application update, and the update was rolled back as a precaution.
2:25 PM UTC: Rolled-back deployment did not resolve the issue; investigation continued.
2:35 PM UTC: Engineers identified a high load on one of the application servers while others remained underutilized.
2:45 PM UTC: Escalated the issue to the network engineering team, suspecting a load balancer configuration issue.
3:00 PM UTC: Network team identified a misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer, where traffic was not evenly distributed across servers.
3:15 PM UTC: Configuration was corrected, and Nginx was reloaded.
3:30 PM UTC: All application servers began receiving traffic, and load distribution returned to normal.
4:00 PM UTC: Full recovery confirmed; application was fully operational, and all services were restored.



Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a misconfigured Nginx load balancer. The load balancer was set to route traffic to only one server instead of distributing it evenly across multiple application servers. This misconfiguration caused the overloaded server to crash due to an excessive number of requests, resulting in the 503 errors that users experienced.
Resolution: The issue was resolved by identifying the misconfiguration in the Nginx load balancer settings. Engineers corrected the configuration to ensure that traffic was properly distributed across all available servers. Once the Nginx configuration was updated and reloaded, the load balancer began routing traffic correctly, leading to the recovery of the application.

Corrective and Preventive Measures
Improvements:
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement additional monitoring for load balancers to detect misconfigurations or uneven traffic distribution before they lead to outages.
Automated Configuration Checks: Introduce automated checks for Nginx configuration changes to ensure that load balancer settings are correct before deployment.
Load Testing: Conduct regular load testing in a staging environment to identify potential issues with load balancing under high traffic conditions.
Tasks:
Implement Monitoring: Add specific monitoring tools to track the health and configuration of the Nginx load balancers.
Automate Configurations: Integrate Nginx configuration checks into the CI/CD pipeline to prevent misconfigurations from being deployed.
Conduct Load Testing: Schedule regular load testing sessions to simulate high-traffic scenarios and validate load balancer performance.
Update Documentation: Review and update the load balancer configuration documentation to include best practices and troubleshooting steps for future reference.
